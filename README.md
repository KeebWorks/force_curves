# force_curves
Force curves of mechanical keyboard switches.

Hi everyone,

This is where you will find all the force curve documentations that I have processed. There will be a picture of the force curve as well as a XLSX sheet that was used to create the force curve. I will be utilizing force curves in my reviews going forward into 2025.

Feel free to use any of the documentation here for your own purposes. They’re free and I will never ask for any compensation regarding them. My only request is that I am credited in some way – A simple link to my YouTube channel or website is all I ask for.

If you have any questions or suggestions. Reach out to me here: https://keebworks.com/contact-us

Thank you,
KeebWorks
